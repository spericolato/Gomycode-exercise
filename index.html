                Kali is the successor to the BackTrack Linux distribution, designed byOffensive Security from the ground up as a penetration testing operatingsystem. It comes with a number of tools preinstalled and is based on DebianLinux, so you’ll also be able to install a wide variety of additional tools andlibraries beyond what’s on the OS to start.First, grab a Kali VM image from the following URL: <br>
                <a href="https://www.kali.org/downloads/"><img src="http://getwallpapers.com/wallpaper/full/7/d/d/162862.jpg" height="500px" width="500px" alt="kali linux desktop"></a> 
                <br>
                .
                2
                Download and decompressthe image, and then double-click it to make VMWare Player ﬁre it up. Thedefault username is
                root 
                and the password is
                toor 
                . This should get you intothe full Kali desktop environment as shown in Figure 1-1.

            <p>
                The network is and always will be the sexiest arenafor a hacker. An attacker can do almost anything withsimple network access, such as scan for hosts, injectpackets, sniff data, remotely exploit hosts, and muchmore. But if you are an attacker who has worked your way into the deepest depths of an enterprise target,
                you may ﬁnd yourself in a bit of a conundrum: you have no tools to executenetwork attacks. No netcat. No Wireshark. No compiler and no means toinstall one. However, you might be surprised to ﬁnd that in many cases, you’ll ﬁnd a Python install, and so that is where we will begin.This chapter will give you some basics on Python networking using the
               socket
               1
                module. Along the way, we’ll build clients, servers, and a TCP proxy;and then turn them into our very own netcat, complete with command shell.
